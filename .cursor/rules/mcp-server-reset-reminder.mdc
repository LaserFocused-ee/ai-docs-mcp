# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL MCP SERVER RELOAD REQUIREMENT ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üö® **NEVER TEST WITHOUT RELOAD - THIS CAUSES HALLUCINATION LOOPS** üö®

### ‚ùå **ASSISTANT WILL HALLUCINATE IF THIS RULE IS BROKEN** ‚ùå

When working with this MCP (Model Context Protocol) server codebase, **ALWAYS** follow this pattern:

### After Making Code Changes:
1. ‚úÖ Make your code edits
2. üîß **BUILD** - Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript
3. üîÑ **TELL THE USER: "Please reload the MCP server in Cursor"**
4. ‚è≥ **WAIT** for user confirmation that they've reloaded
5. ‚úÖ **ONLY THEN** proceed with testing

### üö® **CRITICAL WARNING SIGNS - STOP IMMEDIATELY** üö®
- If you test immediately after changes without reload = **HALLUCINATION**
- If user says "try again" after build = **USER HAS RELOADED - PROCEED**
- If you see old behavior after changes = **NO RELOAD HAPPENED**

### Why This Matters:
- The MCP server runs compiled JavaScript from `dist/` directory
- Changes to TypeScript source files in `src/` don't take effect until compiled
- The MCP client (Cursor/Claude) needs to reload the server to pick up changes
- Testing before rebuilding will show old behavior and cause confusion

### Key Files That Require Rebuild:
- [src/tools/markdown-notion-tools.ts](mdc:src/tools/markdown-notion-tools.ts) - MCP tool definitions
- [src/services/MarkdownNotionConverter.ts](mdc:src/services/MarkdownNotionConverter.ts) - Core conversion logic
- [src/utils/notion-to-markdown.ts](mdc:src/utils/notion-to-markdown.ts) - Notion to markdown conversion
- [src/utils/markdown-to-notion.ts](mdc:src/utils/markdown-to-notion.ts) - Markdown to Notion conversion
- [src/index.ts](mdc:mcp:src/index.ts) - Server entry point

### User's Rebuild Commands:
```bash
npm run build  # Compiles TypeScript and sets up dist/
# Then user reloads MCP server in their client
```

### üî• **EMERGENCY PHRASES TO REMEMBER** üî•
- **"Please reload the MCP server in Cursor"**
- **"I need to wait for you to reload before testing"**
- **"Let me know when you've reloaded the MCP server"**

## üö® **IF USER SAYS "TRY AGAIN" = THEY HAVE RELOADED** üö®

**Remember: Never test immediately after changes - always let user rebuild first!**
